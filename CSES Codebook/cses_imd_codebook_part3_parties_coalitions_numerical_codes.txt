))) IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PHASE 4 RELEASE OF THE CSES INTEGRATED 
    MODULE DATASET (IMD)
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation comprises the Phase 4 
Release of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD). 

The CSES Integrated Module Dataset is being released in a phased way. Thus, 
this release is an advance version of the dataset, and thus lacks some of
the checking, documentation, and inclusion of certain variables that are 
expected with the Full Release of this dataset. 

This Phase 4 Release is provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the data and 
documentation of variables. If users wish to re-use their programming code 
on a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that 
is flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) may wish to monitor the 
errata for CSES IMD on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES IMD Phase 4, go to 
Data Download on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES IMD download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the white box to the right of the page.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) are also advised that 
while the CSES IMD Codebook is comprehensive, users are strongly advised
to consult Standalone CSES Module Documentation including Standalone CSES  
Module Codebooks, Macro Reports, Design Reports, and Election Summaries.


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 3: PARTIES/COALITIONS, HARMONIZED NUMERICAL
    CODES"
===========================================================================

Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook identifies and details the harmonized 
NUMERICAL Coding Schemes used in CSES IMD to refer to the parties/coalitions 
participating in a polity's national elections or previous elections. 

The numerical codes assigned to each party/coalition, which are harmonized
and consistent across all modules and elections in the dataset, are listed 
for each country. 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES IMD CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

CSES IMD Codebook is produced in .txt format to allow for easy accessibility 
and as such, the Codebook can be read into a variety of programs. 
 
The CSES IMD Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with
the following commands allowing for quick searching:
 
)))  = Section Header 

>>>  = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2

===========================================================================
))) CSES CODEBOOK - POLITY NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
===========================================================================

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of POLITY NOTES and
ELECTION STUDY NOTES. They are notes which are attached to each 
variable included in the dataset and refer to case-specific 
information regarding a particular variable. This information
may apply to a polity consistently in the dataset (i.e.: a POLITY NOTE)
or one election study in the dataset (i.e.: an ELECTION STUDY NOTE). 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. 

They can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for "POLITY NOTES" or
"ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in Parts 2-5 of the CSES IMD Codebook.

>>> CSES CODING OF PARTY/COALITIONS AND LEADERS IN CSES IMD - A NEW 
    DEPARTURE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - HARMONIZATION

CSES IMD marks a radical new departure in the CSES approach to the coding
of parties and coalitions. All parties/coalitions or Presidential
candidates, where applicable, participating in the election or the previous
election receive a NUMERICAL code. These codes are used to identify the
following: 

   - who the respondent voted for in the current election (IMD3002). 
   - who the respondent voted for in the previous election (IMD3004).
   - the respondent's party identification (IMD3005_3).
   - Party/coalition that best represents the respondents' views 
     (IMD3016_2). 

These codes are used to identify the following in the macro-component of
the CSES dataset:

   - Numeric Party Code Identifier for Parties A-I (IMD5000_).
   - Party/coalition of the Prime Minister before the election (IMD5008_).
   - Party/coalition of the President before and after the election 
     (IMD5009_).

In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical identifier 
that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit numerical identifier 
contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value to 
distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/coalition codes 
are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD. 

The first three digits of the identifier consist of the three-digit UN 
Polity Identifier Code. The remaining four digits consist of numerical 
codes ranging from 0001 to 9999, with each party/coalition assigned a value 
that remains consistent across Modules.   
In assigning of the last four digits, macro data specialists have assigned 
codes with consistent leading vote-getters in a polity being assigned lower
values. Beyond this, the allocation of the final four digits is random. 

The harmonized and consistent codes for parties/coalitions are detailed
in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. Users can search for the 
following term: "CSES IMD HARMONIZED PARTY/COALITION NUMERICAL CODES"


<<>> CSES IMD NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - IMPORTANT NOTES

In cases of a merger between two parties, the newly created party/coalition
receives a different numerical code from its previous incarnations. 

When parties compete in electoral alliances/coalitions, the 
alliance/coalition receives a different numerical code from the constituent 
parties that make it up. 

Parties/coalitions that merely undergo a name change do not receive a new 
unique code. Instead, a POLITY/ELECTION STUDY NOTE will note the name
change. 


<<>> CSES IMD ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING - RELATIONAL DATA

CSES IMD includes relational data for parties/coalitions. In CSES IMD, as 
in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an ALPHABETICAL 
classification with parties/coalitions where data is available receiving 
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Parties/coalitions A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, 
ordered in descending order of their share of the popular vote in the said
polity's election (unless otherwise stated). Thus, Party A is the 
party/coalition  that received the most votes in the election, party B the 
second most votes, etc...         
Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are 
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple 
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated. 
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e., a constituency and a list  
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the 
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is, ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each polity's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
polity. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.

These codes are used to identify the following in the micro-component of 
the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition 
     (variable IMD3007).
   - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable IMD3008). 

These alphabetical codes are used to identify the distinct and macro level 
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:

   - Election Results: percentage of the vote for each party/coalition in 
     the lower house (variable IMD5001_).
   - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition in the 
     lower house (variable IMD5002_).
   - Election Results: percentage of the vote for each party/coalition in 
     the upper house (variable IMD5003_).
   - Election Results: percentage of seats for each party/coalition in the 
     upper house (variable IMD5004_).
   - Election Results: percentage of the vote for each party/coalition in 
     the Presidential election (variable IMD5005_).
   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's ideological family placement (variable IMD5011_).
   - Expert judgments by the national collaborators of the said party/
     coalition's left-right placement (variable IMD5012_).
   - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition before the 
     election (variable IMD5029_).
   - Number of cabinet portfolios held by each party/coalition after the 
     election (variable IMD5031_).  
   - Manifesto research on political representation identifier
     for each party/coalition (variable IMD5100_).
   - Parliaments and Governments (ParlGov) identifier for each
     party/coalition (variable IMD5101_).
   - The said party/coalition's Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) 
     Identifier (variable IMD5102_).
   - The said party/coalition's Party Facts Identifier 
     (variable IMD5103_).

To allow users to see what party/coalition A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, variable IMD5000 provides identifiers within
the dataset with detailed labels. In addition, Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook details the alphabetical classifications for each polity by 
Standalone CSES Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD 
Codebook with the following term: "ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODES BY
CSES MODULE"


<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING

CSES IMD includes relational data for leaders of parties/coalitions. In
CSES IMD, as in Standalone CSES Modules, this data is coded using an
ALPHABETICAL classification with leaders where data is available receiving
an alphabetical code (A-I). 

Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular 
parties/coalitions or the Presidential candidates of these parties. They 
correspond to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to Party A in 
some way, Leader B will be related to Party B, etc...) 

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to 
parties G, H, I, but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary 
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency 
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots for Leader G, H, and I will 
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders. 
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro 
components of the CSES dataset: 

   - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question 
     (variable IMD3009). 

To allow users to see what Leader A-I refers to in a particular 
election within a polity, Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook details the 
alphabetical classifications of leaders for each polity by Standalone CSES 
Module. Users can search in Part 4 of the CSES IMD Codebook with the 
following term: "ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODES BY CSES MODULE"


===========================================================================
))) CSES IMD PARTY/COALITION HARMONIZED NUMERICAL CODES BY POLITY
===========================================================================

This section details the harmonized numerical codes by polity for each 
political party/coalition in CSES IMD. 

This seven-digit numerical identifier contains information on the polity
and a unique numerical value to distinguish the party/coalition. 

Some codes are consistent across polities, namely: 
   - 9999988: None of the candidates/parties 
   - 9999989: Independent candidate 
   - 9999990: Other left-wing candidate/party (not further specified)
   - 9999991: Other right-wing candidate/party (not further specified) 
   - 9999992: Other candidate/party (not further specified) 
   - 9999993: Invalid/Blank Ballot 

For the most part, these codes are not listed in the below list except
in special circumstances with an accompanying POLITY NOTE or ELECTION 
STUDY NOTE. 

Polities are listed below in alphabetical order.

         | POLITY NOTES - BELGIUM: PARTIES/COALITIONS
         |
         | Almost all Belgian parties are divided into linguistic groups, 
         | and therefore, few parties compete on a national basis. Instead, 
         | most parties compete in one of two predominant linguistic regions  
         | namely Belgium-Flanders (Dutch-speaking region) and Belgium-
         | Wallonia (French-speaking region). Thus, elections to Belgium's 
         | national parliament essentially operate as two distinct elections 
         | for one chamber. Consequently, Two election studies were run in
         | Belgium in 1999 and 2019, respectively - one in Belgium-Flanders,
         | and one in Belgium-Wallonia. 
         | The Flanders region comprises the following areas: Antwerp, East 
         | Flanders, Flemish Brabant, Limburg, and West Flanders.
         | The Wallonia region comprises the following areas: Brabant, 
         | Hainaut, Liege, Luxembourg, and Namur.
         | The Belgium 2003 study was fielded as a national study and not
         | as two regional studies.
         |
         | 0560003: Christian Democratic & Flemish (CD&V) was formerly 
         | known as "Flemish Christian Peoples Party (CVP)." The party 
         | adopted its current name in 2001.
         |         
         | 0560005: Socialist Party Differently (SP.A) adopted its current
         | party name prior to the 2003 Belgian Federal election. The 
         | previous name of the party was "Flemish Socialist Party (SP)".
         |
         | 0560011: Worker's Party of Belgium (PVDA / PTB) contests 
         | elections both in Belgium-Flanders as "Partij van de Arbeid van
         | Belgie (PVDA)" and in Belgium-Wallonia as "Parti du Travail de 
         | Belgique (PTB)".
         |
         | 0560014: Democratic Francophones Front (FDF) is known as 
         | Democratic Federalist Independent (DeFI) since 2015.
         |
         | 0560016: Liberal Reformist Party - Francophone Democratic Front 
         | (PRL - FDF) refers to an electoral alliance between the PRL and
         | the FDF founded in 1993. Joined by the Citizens Movement for
         | Change (MCC) in 1998 and by the Party for Freedom and Progress
         | (PFF), the alliance turned into the Reformist Movement (MR) in 
         | 2002, which has been assigned the IMD party code 0560026.
         |
         | 0560018: Live Differently - Flemish-speaking Ecologists (AGALEV)
         | was renamed to "Green!" in 2003 and "Green" in 2008.

         | POLITY NOTES - HONG KONG: PARTIES/COALITIONS
         |
         | In the 2016 elections (CSES MODULE 5), voters cast one vote 
         | for closed party lists, which were compiled separately for each
         | of the five electoral districts and in some instances feature 
         | more than one list per party per district. 
         | CSES IMD provides individual numerical party codes for each
         | combination of parties forming a joint party list. For example,
         | this is why there are separate codes for People Power - League
         | of Social Democrats (PP - LSD), People Power (PP), and League 
         | of Social Democrats (LSD).
         |
         | In total, three such alliances formed in the 2016 Legislative 
         | Council election. Alliances are listed below, together with the
         | member parties:
         |
         | 3440100: People Power - League of Social Democrats (PP-LSD), 
         | with the following parties contesting as part of this alliance
         | in the New Territories West constituency:
         | - 3440004. People Power (PP)
         | - 3440007. League of Social Democrats (LSD)
         | 
         | 3440101: Civic Passion - Proletariat Political Institute - 
         | Hong Kong Resurgence Order (CP - PPI - HKRO), with the following
         | parties contesting as part of this alliance in the New 
         | Territories East constituency:
         | - 3440039. Civic Passion (CP)
         | - 3440040. Proletariat Political Institute (PPI)
         | - 3440041. Hong Kong Resurgence Order (HKRO)
         |
         | 3440103: AllinHKG, with the following parties contesting as 
         | part of this alliance:

         | - Cheung Sha Wan Community Establishment Power.
         | - Tsz Wan Shan Constructive Power.
         | - Tuen Mun Community.
         |
         | Further, three additional alliances formed in 2016, which are
         | not represented by joint party lists in CSES IMD: 
         |
         | ALLIANCE 1 with the following parties contesting as part of this
         | alliance in the Kowloon West constituency:
         | - 3440045. Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong 
         |            (BPA)
         | - 3440014. Kowloon West New Dynamic
         |
         | ALLIANCE 2 with the following parties contesting as part of this
         | alliance in the constituencies of New Territories West and New 
         | Territories East:
         | - 3440001. Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress 
         |   of Hong Kong (DAB)
         | - New Territories Association of Societies.
         |
         | ALLIANCE 3 with the following parties contesting as part of this
         | alliance in the New Territories East constituency:
         | - 3440008. New People's Party (NPP)

         |
         | The numerical classification of alliances is arbitrary and 
         | denoted by CSES for the ease of users.

         | POLITY NOTES - LATVIA: PARTIES/COALITIONS
         |
         | 4280001: Harmony Centre (SC) started as a coalition in 2005  
         | representing the Russian minority in Latvia on a social-
         | democratic platform. Initially, the SC consisted of four main
         | parties: the National Harmony Party, New Centre, the Social
         | Democratic Party, and the Socialist Party. In 2010, the
         | first three members merged into one political party, namely 
         | Social Democratic Party 'Harmony' (S). Although the Socialist 
         | Party did not formally join the party, it was part of an 
         | electoral alliance with the Social Democratic Party in 2011. In
         | 2014 and 2018, the Socialist Party did not contest the elections
         | but its outgoing members of parliament were placed on the Harmony
         | party list.
         | 
         | 4280003: National Union All for Latvia For Fatherland and
         | Freedom (LNNK) was founded in 2011 and is a merger of the
         | Union "For Fatherland and Freedom"/LNNK (TB/LNNK) and 
         | All for Latvia (PVL). Previously, the two member parties formed
         | an electoral alliance for the 2010 Latvian parliamentary 
         | election.
         |
         | 4280004: For a Good Latvia (PLL) was a right-wing alliance 
         | formed on April 22, 2010. It consisted of The People's Party 
         | (TP),  Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way (LPP/LC), the business 
         | movement For a Good Latvia, and a number of smaller parties. The  
         | alliance was dissolved in October 2011.
         |
         | 4280005: Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS) is an alliance in
         | Latvia established in 2002. Until 2022, its major members were
         | the Latvian Farmers' Union and the Latvian Green Party.
         | The Green Party left ZZS in early 2022 and was replaced by the
         | Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party (LSDSP).
         |
         | 4280007: Reform Party (RP) was known as "Zatlers' Reform Party" 
         | until it changed names on April 21, 2014. In 2014, it competed
         | within the same list as 4280002. Unity (V).
         |
         | 4280008: Social Democratic Party 'Harmony' (S) is the successor 
         |
         | 4280013: For Latvia from the Heart was renamed to Awakening in
         | 2019 and is referred to as such in CSES MODULE 5.
         |
         | 4280024: First Party of Latvia (LPP) was a separate political 
         | party that merged with Latvia's Way (LC) to establish the 
         | Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way (LPP/LC) in 2007. Both founding
         | members already formed an electoral coalition for the Latvian 
         | parliamentary elections in 2006. 
         |
         | 4280028: Eurosceptics changed their name multiple times during 
         | the party's existence. Since 2018, they have been known as Action 
         | Party.
         |
         | 4280036: Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way (LPP/LC) was a merger
         | party of the First Party of Latvia (LPP) and Latvia's Way (LC) 
         | (see code 4280024 above). For the 2010 election, LPP/LC
         | was part of the right-wing alliance "For a Good Latvia (PLL)"
         | (IMD code 4280004). Prior to the 2011 election, the party
         | shortly renamed itself to "Slesers LPP/LC Reform Party" prior to
         | the 2011 election. The party was dissolved in December 2011.
         |
         | 4280039: Latvian Russian Union (LKS) changed its name prior
         | to the 2014 election. Before that, it was named the party
         | For Human Rights in United Latvia (PCTVL). 
         |
         | Next to the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), three alliances 
         | formed in the Latvian 2018 parliamentary election as listed

         | 2019 Tunisian Presidential election. These codes were assigned 
         | to candidates rather than parties/coalitions because the 
         | respective individuals contested as independents. Combining

         | limited users' ability to analyze the 2019 Presidential elections
