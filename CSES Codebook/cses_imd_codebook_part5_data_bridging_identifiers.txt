    MODULE DATASET (IMD)
===========================================================================

This dataset and all accompanying documentation comprises the Phase 4 
Release of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD). 

The CSES Integrated Module Dataset is being released in a phased way. Thus,
this release is an advanced version of the dataset, and thus lacks some of
the checking, documentation, and inclusion of certain variables that are 
expected with the Full Release of this dataset. 

This Phase 4 Release is provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset. We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu."

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the data and 
documentation of variables. If users wish to re-use their programming code 
on a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that 
is flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) may wish to monitor the 
errata for CSES IMD on the CSES website, to check for known errors which 
may impact their analyses. To view errata for CSES IMD Phase 4, go to the 
Data Center on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES IMD download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the gray box to the right of the page.

Users of the CSES Integrated Module Dataset (IMD) are also advised that 
while the CSES IMD Codebook is comprehensive, users are strongly advised
to consult Standalone Module documentation including Standalone Module 
Codebooks, Macro Reports, Design Reports and Election Summaries.


===========================================================================
))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 5: PARTIES/COALITIONS - DATA BRIDGING
                 IDENTIFIERS"
===========================================================================

Part 5 of the CSES IMD Codebook details data bridging identifiers from
other comparative projects. The data bridging identifiers are provided for
all parties/coalitions assigned an alphabetical code in a CSES election
study. We detail data bridging identifiers for the following studies:


     - MARPOR/CMP
       The Manifesto Project (MARPOR/CMP) provides the scientific community 
       with parties' policy positions derived from a content analysis of
       parties' electoral manifestos. It covers over 1000 parties from 1945
       until today in over 50 countries on five continents. The DFG-funded
       MARPOR/CMP project continues the work of the Manifesto Research Group
       (MRG) and the Comparative Manifestos Project (CMP).
 
 
     - ParlGov
       ParlGov is a database that contains information about elections,
       parties and cabinets. ParlGov is a data infrastructure for political
       science and it covers all EU and most OECD democracies
       (37 countries). The database combines approximately 1700 parties,
       1000 elections (9400 results), and 1600 cabinets (3900 parties).


     - CHES
       The Chapel Hill expert surveys estimate party positioning on
       European integration, ideology and policy issues for national
       parties in a variety of European countries. The first survey was
       conducted in 1999, with subsequent waves in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014,
       and 2019. Questions on parties' general position on European
       integration, several EU policies, general left/right, economic
       left/right, and social left/right are common to all surveys.


     - PARTY FACTS
       Party Facts links datasets on political parties and provides an
       online platform about parties and their history as recorded in
       social science datasets.
       Political scientists have accumulated a large amount of data on
       political parties. With this information we can trace the dynamics
       of party competition across countries and time. However, the many
       existing datasets with crucial information about political parties
       are difficult to link. Party Facts establishes an infrastructure
       that supports political scientists in linking parties across
       datasets.


Data Bridging enables users to bring together information from CSES with 
other data sources. The concept is part of CSES Data Linkage efforts. CSES
has been a pioneer of Data Linkage with the inclusion of various 
macro-level data originating from other sources (e.g., The World Bank, 
the IDEA) directly in CSES data products, including in CSES IMD. These 
macro data classify the political system's characteristics and contextual 
conditions of a polity at the election time.  
Data Bridging gives users the power to build on the direct data linkage 
in CSES products by enabling users to easily link other data with CSES 
products. CSES IMD enables users to bridge data with other prominent 
datasets in political science by including standard identifiers at the
polity, year, and party level used by other projects to facilitate 
merging.

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the polity level
with the following variables:
    - IMD1006_UN       ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
    - IMD1006_UNALPHA2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                      TWO LETTER CODE
    - IMD1006_UNALPHA3 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                      THREE LETTER CODE
    - IMD1006_NAM      ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
    - IMD1006_VDEM     ID COMPONENT - V-Dem POLITY IDENTIFIER
    
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1006_UN") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the regional 
level through the following variable:  
    - IMD1006_REG      ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS NUMERIC
                                      CODES

More details can be found on this variable in CSES IMD Codebook Part 2
by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1006_REG") or using the
search term "POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets by date through 
the following variables:  
    - IMD1008_YEAR     ID COMPONENT - ELECTION YEAR
    - IMD1011_M        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - MONTH
    - IMD1011_D        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - DAY
    - IMD1011_Y        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YEAR
    - IMD1011_1        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYY-MM-DD
    - IMD1011_2        DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYYMM
    - IMD1012_M        DATE 2ND ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - MONTH
    - IMD1012_D        DATE 2ND ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - DAY
    - IMD1012_Y        DATE 2ND ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YEAR
    - IMD1012_1        DATE 2ND ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYY-MM-DD
    - IMD1012_2        DATE 2ND ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - YYYYMM                 

More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD1008_YEAR") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 

CSES IMD facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the
party/coalition level with the following variables: 
    - IMD5100_A-I      MANIFESTO RESEARCH ON POLITICAL REPRESENTATION 
                       (MARPOR/CMP) IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I
    - IMD5101_A-I      PARLIAMENTS AND GOVERNMENT DATABASE (PARLGOV) 
                       IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I
    - IMD5102_A-I      CHAPEL HILL EXPERT SURVEY (CHES) IDENTIFIER -
                       PARTY A-I
    - IMD5103_A-I      PARTY FACTS IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I 

More details can be found on all these variables in CSES IMD Codebook 
Part 2 by searching for the variable name (e.g., "IMD5100_A") or using
the search term "POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER."
Users can find the specific bridging codes for each party/coalition
assigned an alphabetical code in CSES here in Part 5 of the CSES
IMD Codebook (see below).


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES IMD CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

CSES IMD Codebook is produced in .txt format to allow for easy accessibility 
and as such, the Codebook can be read into a variety of programs. 
 
The CSES IMD Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with
the following commands allowing for quick searching:
 
)))  = Section Header 

>>>  = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2

+++  = Tables

VARIABLES NOTES = Notes for particular variables. 

POLITY NOTES = Notes for a particular polity.  

[POLITY NOTES] = Notes for a particular polity where data in CSES IMD
deviates from published data in Standalone CSES Modules.

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study.  

[ELECTION STUDY NOTES] = Notes for a particular election study where data
in CSES IMD deviates from published data in Standalone CSES Modules.

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.


===========================================================================
))) CSES IMD CODEBOOK - POLITY NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
===========================================================================

A unique dimension of the CSES is the inclusion of POLITY NOTES and
ELECTION STUDY NOTES. They are notes which are attached to each 
variable included in the dataset and refer to case-specific 
information regarding a particular variable. This information
may apply to a polity consistently in the dataset (i.e., a POLITY NOTE)
or one election study in the dataset (i.e., an ELECTION STUDY NOTE). 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. 

They can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for "POLITY NOTES" or
"ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in Parts 2-5 of the CSES IMD Codebook.


===========================================================================
))) MISSING CODES FOR BRIDGING IDENTIFIERS
===========================================================================

For all parties/coalitions that are assigned an alphabetical classification
in CSES IMD, CSES provides identifiers from four other comparative projects,
namely the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR, formerly
the Comparative Manifesto Project, CMP) Project, the Parliament and 
Government (ParlGov) Database, the Chapel Hill Expert Surveys (CHES), and 
the Party Facts Database.

Below, we list the identifiers assigned by each project to a party/coalition
included in CSES IMD and which have been assigned an alphabetical
classification. This allows for data bridging between CSES IMD and these 
datasets at the party/coalition level.

However, data is not always available for a party appearing in CSES in some
of these projects or because CSES assigns an alphabetical code to a party
that is not assigned a party code in these projects.
For example, MARPOR/CMP assigns code 62420 to Liberal Party (LIB) in Canada,
but in CSES, this party is assigned numerical code 1240001. The same party
does not exist in the CHES dataset and is therefore assigned
"9999. Missing" code for the CHES bridging identifier.  

Data are listed in CSES IMD Codebook Part 5 only for polities and
parties/coalitions where information is available in the accompanying
dataset. When unavailable for a polity or party/coalition, this is listed
in the CSES IMD dataset as "999999. NOT AVAILABLE IN MANIFESTO RESEARCH
ON POLITICAL REPRESENTATION PROJECT" or "9999. NOT AVAILABLE ..." for all
other projects. In the documentation below, when data is unavailable for a
particular party/coalition in a polity/study where data is mostly available,
it is listed as "999999" or "9999". In cases where data is unavailable for
all parties/coalitions for a particular polity/study, there is no
corresponding documentation entry below. 
 
Polities are listed in alphabetical order. Parties/coalitions are listed in
order of their numeric party code assignment in each polity. 

Below, we list the election studies present in CSES but where data is
absent from four other projects by alphabetical order and by year:

Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify coalitions 
differently in elections and across polities. For example CSES sometimes 
has data solely on coalitions and not the parties comprising the alliance, 
while MARPOR/CMP may have data concerning the individual parties in the 
coalition, or vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non comprehensive 
list of these deviations are noted in POLITY NOTES below.

         | POLITY NOTES - HUNGARY: PARTY IDS FROM OTHER COMPARATIVE STUDIES
         |
         | The Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and Dialogue for Hungary 
         | formed an electoral alliance in the 2018 legislative election
         | (CSES MODULE 5). 
         | For this contest, MARPOR/CMP, CHES and Party Facts do not include
         | data on the alliance. Instead, individual parties are classified. 
         |
         | MARPOR/CMP data for these parties for this contest is available 
         | under codes:
         | - 86220 (MSZP)
         | - 86111 (Dialogue for Hungary)
         |
         | CHES data for these parties for this contest is available under
         | codes:       
         | - 2301 (MSZP)
         | - 2312 (Dialogue for Hungary)
         |
         | Party Facts data for these parties for this contest is available 
         | under codes:       
         | - 1408 (MSZP)
         | - 3115 (Dialogue for Hungary)
         |
         | Dialogue for Hungary and "Together" formed an electoral alliance
         | in the previous 2014 legislative election (CSES MODULE 5). 
         | CMP/MARPOR does not award a separate code for "Together" for the
         | 2018 election, but continues using the alliance code 86340, 
         | reported in the table above. As the vote share reported by 
         | CMP/MARPOR (0.66%) matches the election result for "Together"
         | in 2018, CSES assumes that data reported under code 86340 refer
         | to "Together" in 2018 rather than the alliance.

         | assigned an alphabetical classification in CSES IMD.
         |
         | The CSES Convention is that when a party competes in election
         | as part of the coalition, that coalition gets a new, unique, 
         | party code (for more details see CSES IMD Stimulus Paper).
         | Other comparative projects handle this differently, thus
         | MARPOR/CMP and ParlGov codes are identical for MANA Movement 
         | (MANA) and 2016 coalition between MANA Movement and Internet 
         | Party (IP - MANA).
         |
         | ParlGov uses two different codes for the Conservative Party/
         | New Conservative over time. Code 1973 is used by ParlGov until 
         | the 2014 election, and is hence applied to the New Zealand 2011
         | and 2014 studies in CSES IMD. 
         | For 2020, ParlGov applies code 2806 for New Conservative, 
         | applicable to the New Zealand 2020 study in CSES IMD.
