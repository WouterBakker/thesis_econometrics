this webpage, there is an overview of what I’ve done so far, with links
to the corresponding Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks contain
information on what I’ve implemented and how the code works.</h3>
<ul>
<li>General
<ul>
<li>My functions are implemented in the file <a
href="Python/class_FE_regression.py">class_FE_regression.py</a>
<ul>
<li>When a class or function is called in a notebook, they will be in
this file</li>
</ul></li>

<li><a href="Python/FE_OLS_hypothesis_testing.ipynb">Simulation study:
Fixed Effects regression</a>
<ol type="1">
<li>Implemented so far: simulation, estimation, t-values, type I
errors</li>
<li>Two models are compared in the notebook:
<ol type="1">
<li>Regular FE model
<ol type="1">
<li>Regular FE model estimated using the within (demeaning)
transformation</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Weighted FE model
<ol type="1">
<li>Accounts for missing values in X</li>
<li>Missing values occur for two reasons in pseudo-panel models:
<ol type="1">
<li>General missingness: no observations for a time-period since survey
wasn’t taken in that year for specific countries</li>
<li>Cohort missingness: some cohorts were not observed</li>
<li>Item missingness: a respondent declined to answer a specific
question</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Procedure
<ol type="1">
<li>Sets some observations to zero (to simulate missingness)</li>
<li>Constructs a weighting matrix based these missing values so they are
omitted in estimation (0-values don’t affect sum of squares)</li>
<li>Corrects the variance calculation used to construct the covariance
matrix
<ol type="1">
<li>One of the steps is to calculate the variance for each
cross-sectional unit</li>
<li>Normally we can divide by T, but since T is different for each unit
this needs to be accounted for (more details in the notebook)</li>

<li>Inoue (2008): “efficient estimation and inference in linear
pseudo-panel data models”
<ol type="1">
<li>Inoue suggests a GMM estimator based on feasible GLS that is more
efficient than the standard FE estimator for pseudo-panel models</li>
<li>He performs a Monte Carlo simulation study and finds that the RMSE
of <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> is much lower for the GMM
estimator as compared to the FE estimator
<ol type="1">
<li>I tried to replicate this study, but my results are not the
same</li>
<li>The RMSE is very similar to FE OLS, even slightly worse</li>
<li>Two things need attention:
<ol type="1">
<li>Need to verify whether my <strong>simulation parameters</strong> are
indeed the same as Inoue’s
<ol type="1">
<li>It might be that I’m simulating the data incorrectly.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Construction of the <strong>weighting matrix</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>When weighting matrix is set to identity the results are equal to
OLS</li>
<li>When weighting matrix is as specified in Inoue it performs the same
as a random weighting matrix</li>

<li>ESS analysis</li>
