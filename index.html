this webpage, there is an overview of what I’ve done so far, with links
to the corresponding Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks contain
information on what I’ve implemented and how the code works.</h3>

<li>General
<ul>
<li>My functions are implemented in the file <a
href="Python/class_FE_regression.py">class_FE_regression.py</a>
<ul>
<li>When a class or function is called in a notebook, it will be in this
file</li>

Fixed Effects regression</a>
<ol type="1">
<li>Implemented so far: simulation, estimation, t-values, type I
errors</li>
<li>Two models are compared in the notebook:
<ol type="1">
<li>Regular FE model
<ol type="1">
<li>Regular FE model estimated using the within (demeaning)
transformation</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Weighted FE model
<ol type="1">
<li>Accounts for missing values in X</li>
<li>Missing values occur for two reasons in pseudo-panel models:
<ol type="1">
<li>General missingness: no observations for a time-period since survey
wasn’t taken in that year for specific countries</li>
<li>Cohort missingness: some cohorts were not observed</li>
<li>Item missingness: a respondent declined to answer a specific
question</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Procedure
<ol type="1">
<li>Sets some observations to zero (to simulate missingness)</li>
<li>Constructs a weighting matrix based these missing values so they are
omitted in estimation (0-values don’t affect sum of squares)</li>
<li>Corrects the variance calculation used to construct the covariance
matrix
<ol type="1">
<li>One of the steps is to calculate the variance for each
cross-sectional unit</li>
<li>Normally we can divide by T, but since T is different for each unit
this needs to be accounted for (more details in the notebook)</li>

</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Inoue suggests a GMM estimator based on feasible GLS that is more
efficient than the standard FE estimator for pseudo-panel models</li>
<li>He performs a Monte Carlo simulation study and finds that the RMSE
of <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> is much lower for the GMM
estimator as compared to the FE estimator
<ol type="1">
<li>My RMSE is indeed significantly lower, but the results are not the
same as in Inoue, and I’m unsure why</li>
<li>Need to verify whether my <strong>simulation parameters</strong> are
indeed the same as Inoue’s
<ol type="1">
<li>It might be that I’m simulating the data incorrectly.</li>

<li><a href="Python/ESS_pseudo_panel_analysis.html">European Social
Survey (ESS) analysis</a>
<ol type="1">
<li>The European Social Survey (ESS) is a cross-national survey
conducted biennially across Europe, collecting data on social,
political, and behavioral attitudes and values. It aims to track
long-term changes and differences across countries, providing insights
for social science research and informing policy decisions.</li>
<li>Good candidate for an analysis, since the documentation is very
good.</li>
<li>The aim (currently) is to provide methodological guidelines on how
one might approach the analysis of survey data using the proposed
pseudo-panel model.
<ul>
<li>Constructing the cohorts based on post-stratification
<ul>
<li>Need to consider the instrumental variabel interpretation of cohort
formation:
<ul>
<li>Exogeneity and relevance conditions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Applying the weights correctly</li>
<li>Informed choice for imputation techniques when data are Missing at
Random (as opposed to Missing Completely at Random, which is
ignoreable)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="Python/ESS_bar_charts.htmlESS_bar_charts">Distribution of
variables</a>
<ul>
<li>Most questions in the survey are scored on a 10-point scale. For
certain variables of interest, I plot their distribution and show item
missingness.</li>
